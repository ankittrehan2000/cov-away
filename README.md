Covaway loads real-time covid data using multiple third-party APIs for the past several days and then suggests indoor/outdoor activities based on factors like case count and case trends. It shows small restaurants by filtering out large chains, the reason for this is because small businesses have been struggling throughout this pandemic and this with this tool people can find the perfect place to not only spend their money but also help people in need.

It also shows a little shopping section where it recommends what you should get based on the covid data around you. Decreasing cases? Increasing cases? No cases? It has you covered with shopping recommendations
